# AYOLOv3-Tiny
This is the code for my paper.<br>
Paper title:<br>
AYOLOv3-Tiny: An improved convolutional neural network architecture for real-time defect detection of PAD light guide plates<br>
Some of the code is not used in the solution process of this article, so please view it in an optional way.
# Environment
Pytorch 1.5.0<br>
Python 3.7<br>
# To test
The configration does not need to be changed. All you need is to change "data/test.txt".<br>
The dataset has been uploaded to https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E9FOB6rZr3ZJYq2Hpyxyh5tdP_n6w_9m/view?usp=sharing<br>
Download the dataset and then put it in a right place.<br>
Run test.py<br>
# To detect
Put your images in "data/samples", and then run detect.py. The resluts are shown in output.<br>
